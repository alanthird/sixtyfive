sixtyfive (6502 Emulator) V0.1.1
--------------------------------

Written by Alan Third (watched by Alisdair McDiarmid).

FIRST
-----

See LICENCE for copying instructions. Don't fret about it though, we're
obviously not that bothered (see the licence for proof of this).


USAGE
-----

To compile, just do:

    make

and it compiles no problems. Honest.

Usage is:

    ./sixtyfive <filename>

(where filename is a 6502 binary -- you'll want a cross assembler like
[xa](http://stockholm.ptloma.edu/cbm/xa/) to make these).


STATUS
------

The emulator currently supports most instructions, excluding any "non-standard"
ones or anything relating to interupts. We're going to do interrupts soon,
followed by anything else we forgot.

LAST WORDS
----------

Have fun!
