Stuff still to be done:

* create a test suite using results from a real 6502 as reference

* code the entire front end (more details forthcoming)

* add stuff I couldn't be arsed with previously such as Decimal operation
  and interupts

* determine how to keep the clock ticking over correctly at 1MHz or so

* write a 6502 assembler


Sorted:

* Sort any instructions which affect the N register such as ADC and SBC
  to actually make use of it
> Think I've sorted all the problems with that and the Z flag, it's just
  a matter of remembering to deal with it in instructions coded later
                                                                   -- AT
* complete any instructions not marked off in instructions/*
> All done except for some interrupt stuff and suchlike.
                                                                   -- AT
