Immediate:
	the byte in memory directly after the opcode is used for the operation

absolute:
	the byte in ram directly after the opcode contains the low byte of an
	address, the next one contains the high byte, the byte stored at the 
	address is used by the operation

zero page:
	the byte following the opcode contains the low byte of an address, the
	top byte of the address is 0x00

implied (accumulator)
	no memory access is required as the instruction deals with specific
	locations (ie. registers)

zero page, x:
	the byte following the opcode is added to the byte contained in the
	x register, this then functions as the low byte in zero page addressing

absolute, x or y:
	the address is found as in absolute, but the value in x or y is added
	to the address

indirect, x:
	the byte following the opcode is added to teh x register which is then
	used as the low byte in a zero page address which contains the low byte
	of another address and the zero page address+1 is the high byte

indirect, y:
	the byte following the opcode is used as in zero page to find a memory
	address, the contents of this address is then added to the contents of
	the y register and this gives the low byte of an address. the next byte
	in zero page has the carry of the last addition added to it to give the
	high byte of an address
